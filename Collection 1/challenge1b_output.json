Winston Churchill noted that when he set out to read Gibbon’s multi-volume work, he simply “devoured” it, and “rode triumphantly through it from end to end and enjoyed it all” (Churchill, My Early Life, 111). Gibbon worked tirelessly to produce this comprehensive history of one of the greatest empires of the world.",
